# blogx

Simple dev setup

## 1. Clone

If you want to avoid browser warnings:

- Register `certs/localhost.pem` to your host machine’s trust store

## 4. Start dev server

```zsh
z
dev
```

## 5. Access

Open https://localhost in your browser

gh auth login

# Place `.gitconfig` at project root

cp .gitconfig ~/.gitconfig

# Receive and place `.env.keys` at project root

z
decrypt
```

If you're on Apple Silicon, it probably just works — same as my setup
